# 🚀 Welcome to Kapsules by GENR8

**Kapsules** is an AI-powered no-code platform that turns your ideas into fully functional web applications—just by describing them in plain English.

Whether you're a founder, creative, or entrepreneur, you can launch full-stack apps without writing code or hiring developers.

## 🌐 What is Kapsules?

Kapsules interprets your natural language prompt and generates a complete, working web application. It builds the file structure, writes the code, and displays a live, interactive preview—all in real time.

**Example Prompt**:

> _"Create a task management app with login and dark mode."_

Within seconds, Kapsules generates:

- Auth scaffolding
- Dashboard layout
- Theme toggler
- Live preview

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **User prompt** → Describe what you want
2. **AI interprets** → Identifies intent, structure, components
3. **Codebase generated** → React + Tailwind + backend scaffolding
4. **Preview renders** → View your app in a live sandbox
5. **Chat continues** → Iterate and improve via AI
