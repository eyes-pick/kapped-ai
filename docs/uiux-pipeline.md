# UI/UX Development Pipeline

This guide provides a step-by-step workflow for the UI/UX development team. Following this pipeline will help you catch build errors early and fix bugs efficiently.

## 1. Update Your Local Environment

1. **Pull the latest code:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## 2. Validate the Codebase

Run the quality checks before making changes:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test
```

Fix any issues reported by these commands to ensure the build remains stable.

## 3. Implement UI/UX Changes

- Create a feature branch for your work:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/my-ui-update
  ```
- Implement your design or bug fix.
- Keep commits small and descriptive.

## 4. Run the Development Server

Start the local environment to verify your changes:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Address runtime errors or layout issues before proceeding.

## 5. Build and Test

After implementing your changes, perform a full build to catch production issues:

```bash
npm run build
```

If you encounter build errors, re-run the quality checks and inspect the console output for missing modules or type errors. Resolve the issues, then rebuild.

## 6. Submit a Pull Request

1. Push your branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-ui-update
   ```
2. Open a pull request and request code review.
3. Ensure all CI checks pass before merging.

Following this pipeline helps the UI/UX team maintain a reliable application and quickly resolve build errors or bugs.
