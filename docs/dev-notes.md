# 🛠 Developer Notes for Kapsules by GENR8

This document tracks internal development decisions, architecture insights, and active implementation notes for building and maintaining the **Kapsules** platform.

---

## 📦 Current Stack

* **Framework**: Next.js (App Router)
* **Styling**: TailwindCSS + ShadCN/UI
* **AI Integration**: OpenAI (gpt-4o), Claude (fallback model planned)
* **Filesystem**: In-memory + optional persistent (E2B or Supabase)
* **Preview**: iframe sandbox with controlled context loading
* **State**: Zustand (global), useLocalStorage for per-project state

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

```
[ Prompt Input ]
      ↓
[ AI Interpreter (LLM) ]
      ↓
[ Template Engine + File Writer ] → [ Virtual FS ] → [ Preview Sandbox ]
                                  ↓
                            [ Chat + Iteration Layer ]
```

* File writing is abstracted via a `FileOrchestrator.ts`
* Prompt parsing → intent → scaffolds pulled from `/templates/*`
* Preview reloads only changed modules using message passing into iframe

---

## 🔄 Change Management

* **AI-Generated File Changes**:

  * Changes tracked in a change buffer before committing to FS
  * Rollback capability in development

* **User Modifications**:

  * Eventually editable in in-app file view (planned)
  * Currently only modifiable via prompt interface

---

## 🔥 Hot Areas / Priorities

* Improve AI feedback loop latency
* Add diff/patch view between AI generations
* Optimize iframe performance (strip unused Tailwind at build-time)
* Add `/.genr8` metadata dir to each project for internal use

---

## 🧪 Experimental Ideas

* Dual-mode edit interface: visual builder + code view
* Voice-to-code input (using Whisper)
* Add GPT function calling to isolate code logic generation

---

## 📌 Dev Checklist

* [ ] AI prompt context management (per project)
* [ ] Auth integration via Supabase or Clerk
* [ ] Add export-to-ZIP button
* [ ] Add localStorage fallback for offline builds
* [ ] Expand prompt understanding with intent tree map
